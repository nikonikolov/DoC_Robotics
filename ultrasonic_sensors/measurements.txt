1.
    1.1 Sensible values - consistent measures but wrong
        MIN DIST = 2cm - measured as 6cm 
        MAX DIST = 92cm - measured as 96cm

    Reliable measurements
        MIN DIST = 20cm
        MAX DIST = 85cm

2. MAX ANGLE =    
   The angle is measured relative to the perpendicular, not relative to the wall
