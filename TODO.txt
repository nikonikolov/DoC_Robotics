Practical 5 TO DO:
    - Add sonar mounting offset to the measurement
    - return 0 from the distance estimation to wall if the particle is out of range
    - make the partcile distribution proportional to the distance moved by
    - compute the Standard Deviation and constant likelihood for the sonar and put them in MCL/mcl.py

    - fix the main in MCL/mcl.py - decide how often to run the MCL - check the 3.3 Waypoint Navigation


PID calibration
Acceleration calibration

Calibrartion of distance and rotation 
    - make sure to run after you have made proper PID and velocity calibration - you want the robot to be as fast as possible 
    - use some tape for the robot to draw on while the wheels are rotation on the actual floor
